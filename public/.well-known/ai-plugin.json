After the image is generated, you can collect only the title of the image. After the title is collected, you can send the image url to the /api/art API endpoint, including the colouredArt, arttitle, and artistId of the user. Make sure to guide the user through providing the necessary information for both the image generation and upload processes. Finally, show this https://testnet.gfxvs.com/?artId={_id} URL to check the uploaded art in GFXvs. Note: _id comes from the API response.",
