## Description

Daily art battle will automate the process of voting for art pieces, minting NFTs for participants, and incentivizing continuous engagement through a unique reward mechanism. The concept, titled ""Daily Art Battle"" (DAB), pits two pieces of art (A vs B) against each other, with the community voting for their favourite. Winners and participants receive NFT rewards based on the outcome and their participation streak.

## Project Walkthrough
There are two kinds of participants in this application:
- Artists: Who create the art and upload it to the platform.
- Audience: Who cast their votes for the artworks and give upvotes to upcoming arts.


## Key Features
### For Artists

1. **Upload Art:** 
   - Artists can upload their art for the battle. They need to upload two versions:
     - **Unique Rare:** This is the highest quality version of the art and will be minted as a single edition (1:1). It will be awarded to one lucky winner who picks this art in the battle.
     - **Derivative Edition:** This version will be given as a participation reward to everyone who picks the artist's art in the battle. It should be a derivative of the Unique Rare, with variations such as grayscale, glitched, watermarked, etc.
   - **Art Title:** Artists must enter a title for their artwork. This title will appear on the site and in the participants' wallets.


**For Audience:**
1. **Join the Battle:**
Audience members can join the battle by connecting their NEAR wallet.

2. **Vote for Art:**
